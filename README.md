# orkidethai.com
A website created by Tony Le for Orkide Thai Restaurang Tranemo, a family-owned restaurant.

## About
The restaurant previously had a website that was subpar. Tony took it upon himself to learn web development and create a new, improved website for the owners with updated information. The redesigned site is built using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on a custom domain. The goal was to replace the poorly made third-party solution with a mobile-friendly, customizable design that enhances user experience and accessibility.
